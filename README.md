# City Of Toronto Data Science Projects

I lived in the Greater Toronto Area for more than 15 years. The City is diverse and has many beautiful scenaries and amazing events all year around. It is one of my favourite City to live in as well as the nicest people in the world.

Feel free to take a look at my data analysis projects in the city of Toronto, Ontario. All of the data are collected from the open source websites from individual organization. All datasets contain references. Feel free to contact me and ask any question. 

Thanks,
