ITS Performance Measures Metrics

Intelligent Transportation Systems include smart technologies on highway and mobile vehicles to travel more efficiently and effectively. ITS already existed in 2008. In order to evaluate its performance, the metrics and plans should be included and brainstormed. The report above listed several performance measure evaluations for the Windsor Border Crossing ITS project.

Key metrics and evaluation include applying algorthms to measure vehicle speed, travel time, using GPS for vehicle tracking, and comparing results with actual data recordings. Other performance strategic plans are distribute Customer Survey Questionnaire, generate queuing-time modeling and comparing incident time response before and after ITS implementation.

The report suggested the right traffic data collection is key and the first step towards evaluating ITS performance.
