Toronto-Traffic-Incident-Redlight-Camera

The Killed and Seriously Injured (KSI) dataset was gathered from the Toronto Police Service website Public Safety Data Portal show here http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/ksi. This data contain over 12000 traffic incidents from 2008 to 2018 for people who were killed and seriously injured. There are many features within the dataset, but I am only focusing on the incident involved with running over the traffic red lights. Running over red light is a safety issue. The City Of Toronto installed redlight camera at various intersections. The red light camera locations data can be found here. https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/locations-and-mapping/#54afa6d4-5547-498a-dc33-36dedb70d360

After red light camera installed, do vehicles continue running over intersections with red light camera and causing serious life threatening incidents?
