# Toronto-Traffic-Incident-Redlight-Camera

The Killed and Seriously Injured (KSI) dataset was gathered from the Toronto Police Service website Public Safety Data Portal show here http://data.torontopolice.on.ca/datasets/ksi. This data contain over 12000 traffic incidents from 2008 to 2018 for people who were killed and seriously injured. There are many features within the dataset, but I am only focusing on the incident involved with running over the traffic red lights. Running over red light is a safety issue. The City Of Toronto installed redlight camera at various intersections. The red light camera locations data can be found here. https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/open-data-catalogue/locations-and-mapping/#54afa6d4-5547-498a-dc33-36dedb70d360

After red light camera installed, do vehicles continue running over intersections with red light camera and causing serious life threatening incidents?

Brief overview of the KSI dataset for red light.

The highest incident occurred in 2008, 2012, 2013 and 2014. What caused the increase of incident in these years. The graph below shows the red light incidents per district.

In 2008, Scarborough has the highest red light vehicle incidents, but between 2009 to 2011, a decreasing trend was happening at Scarborough. In 2012, Toronto and East York had the most incidents. This was a big increase from 2011. It would be interesting to find out the reasons behind the decreasing trend in Scarborough between 2009 to 2011 and the sudden increase of red light incidents at Toronto and East York in 2012.
